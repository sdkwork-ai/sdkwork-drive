# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v2 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Resolve the
task category before loading broad context, and verify the changed boundary
before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

Canonical global authorities from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_DEPLOY_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`

Do not copy global normative bodies into this repository. Stop and report a
broken workspace layout if these relative paths do not resolve.

## Application Identity

`sdkwork.app.config.json` owns Drive identity, runtime declarations, release
metadata, and package inventory. `etc/sdkwork.deployment.config.json` owns the
source profile index; concrete URLs, binds, ports, and runtime values live
under `etc/`.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `sdkwork.workflow.json`: package/release/deployment workflow declaration.
- `specs/topology.spec.json`: topology v5 process and surface contract.
- `etc/`: safe source configuration and profile instances.
- `deployments/`: deployment and infrastructure descriptors.
- `apis/`: Drive-owned API authorities and OpenAPI inputs.
- `apps/`: runnable application surfaces; use the nearest `AGENTS.md`.
- `crates/`: Rust libraries and process hosts.
- `sdks/`: generated SDK families and composed facades.
- `.sdkwork/`: local skills, plugins, and repository metadata.
- `scripts/`, `tools/`, `tests/`, `docs/`: lifecycle adapters, validators, tests, and Canon documentation.

Documentation entrypoints are `docs/README.md`, `docs/product/prd/PRD.md`, and
`docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Spec Resolution Order

Use dynamic progressive loading before implementation files:

1. Read this file and any nearer `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json`, `etc/`, local `specs/`, or `.sdkwork/` only when the task reaches that contract.
3. Use the relevant row in `../sdkwork-specs/README.md` to select global authorities.
4. Inspect implementation only after resolving ownership and vocabulary.

Language-specific specs are on-demand and load only for the language being changed.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Lifecycle/topology: `PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`, `APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`, `CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `ENVIRONMENT_SPEC.md`, `TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Source config: `SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `ENVIRONMENT_SPEC.md`, `RUNTIME_DIRECTORY_SPEC.md`.
- Release/deploy: `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, `RELEASE_SPEC.md`, `SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md`, `SDKWORK_DEPLOY_SPEC.md`, `QUALITY_GATE_SPEC.md`.
- API/SDK: `API_SPEC.md`, `SDK_SPEC.md`, `SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`, `WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, `TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Security/auth: `IAM_SPEC.md`, `IAM_LOGIN_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`, `SECURITY_SPEC.md`, `PRIVACY_SPEC.md`.
- Rust: `RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`; TypeScript/Node: `TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`; frontend: `FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md` and the selected UI architecture spec.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.
- Verification: `node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace .`

## Code Style Rules

Code changes follow `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and
`../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`. Build runners and `clean` follow
`CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` section 7 and must not delete tracked build-critical
sources.

## Build, Test, and Verification

Public lifecycle commands are `pnpm dev`, `pnpm dev:standalone`,
`pnpm dev:cloud`, `pnpm stop`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm check`,
`pnpm verify`, and `pnpm clean`. Run the narrowest changed-surface check first,
then broaden only when the change crosses contracts.

Important local gates include:

```powershell
pnpm check:pnpm-script-standard
pnpm check:docs-standard
pnpm check:agent-workflow-standard
pnpm topology:validate
pnpm deploy:validate
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-source-config-standard.mjs --root .
```

## Agent Execution Rules

Use the convention dictionary before broad source loading. Do not hand-edit
generated SDK output, replace composed SDKs with raw HTTP, or bypass the public
`sdkwork-app` lifecycle facade. Preserve unrelated worktree changes and record
exact verification evidence.

SDK consumer import work routes to
`../sdkwork-specs/APP_SDK_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`,
`../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md`, and
`../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`. Validate with
`node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-app-sdk-consumer-imports.mjs --workspace .`.

HTTP input/output work routes to `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` sections 4.5 and
14-16 plus the affected framework, SDK, migration, and test authorities. Use
the API response and operation-pattern validators selected by those specs.

List/search work routes to `../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and its linked
API, database, backend, SDK, and frontend authorities. Validate with
`node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-pagination.mjs --workspace .`.

## Human Review Rules

Human review is required for public identity or naming changes, breaking API or
SDK changes, security/auth changes, database migrations, production deployment
governance, generated SDK ownership, and release publication.

<!-- SDKWORK-NAMING-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Naming And Dependency Declaration

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1 and section 3.2.

Two identifier planes exist in every Rust crate and they MUST NOT be mixed: the package plane
(Cargo, filesystem, lock file) uses kebab-case, and the crate plane (lib target, modules, source
imports) uses snake_case.

- `[package].name`, the crate directory, `[features]` keys, and `[[bin]].name` use kebab-case.
- `[lib].name`, module files, module directories, and Rust imports use snake_case.
- A crate whose `[package].name` contains a hyphen SHOULD declare `[lib].name` explicitly
  (default: package name with every `-` replaced by `_`). A shorter lib name is allowed only
  when declared explicitly and used consistently by every consumer.
- Cargo dependency keys, `[workspace.dependencies]` keys, and `Cargo.lock` entries use the
  dependency package name. Use `package = "..."` when an alias is required.
- Every external crate referenced by `src/` MUST be declared in that crate's `[dependencies]`.
  Test-only crates belong in `[dev-dependencies]`; `build.rs` crates belong in
  `[build-dependencies]`.
- Never delete a dependency line, and never demote one from `[dependencies]` to
  `[dev-dependencies]`, while `src/` still imports it. Verify manifest cleanups with the
  command below before committing them.
- Regenerate and commit `Cargo.lock` in the same change as any dependency table edit.

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-crate-naming-standard.mjs --root .

<!-- /SDKWORK-NAMING-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-RUST-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline); package/crate
naming and dependency declaration are normative in `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1
and 3.2.

- Crates are responsibility-shaped: service, repository-sqlx, routes, service-host, native-host,
  worker, assembly, gateway. No generic `core`/`common`/`backend`/`runtime` suffixes.
- Errors are typed enums (`thiserror`) implementing `std::error::Error` with a `source` chain.
  `anyhow` only at binary/CLI/test boundaries, never in lib `[dependencies]`.
- No `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment; crates default to `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.
  No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in library code reachable from public API.
- No lock guard held across `.await`; every external await has a timeout; spawned tasks are
  awaited/detached with a documented owner; retries are bounded, jittered, and idempotent.
- Public API is minimal, documented, `#[must_use]` where applicable, and semver-clean. Leaking
  framework types (`sqlx::Row`, axum extractors) through public signatures is forbidden.
- Workspace root declares `[workspace.package]` (edition, rust-version) and `[workspace.lints]`
  (RUST_CODE_SPEC.md section 13 baseline); every member inherits both with
  `edition.workspace = true` and `[lints] workspace = true`.

<!-- /SDKWORK-RUST-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-TYPESCRIPT-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## TypeScript Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline).

- `tsconfig` runs `strict: true` and the strict family; public APIs are typed and `any`-free.
  `import type` is required for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- Errors are typed at package/service boundaries; no empty catches, no swallowed promise
  rejections, no bare `throw new Error('...')` for business failures.
- Async: every promise is settled; external awaits have timeouts; `AbortSignal` accepted for
  cancellable work; bounded concurrency; no unbounded `Promise.all`.
- Public API is minimal, JSDoc-documented, `@deprecated` where applicable, and semver-clean.
- Discriminated unions model closed variant sets; no `as`/`@ts-ignore` bypasses without a guard.
- Node/build runners verify build-critical sources and self-heal from git (CODE_STYLE_SPEC §7);
  `pnpm clean` never deletes git-tracked build-critical files.

pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm lint

<!-- /SDKWORK-TYPESCRIPT-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-FRONTEND-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Frontend Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2); language rules follow
`../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (React/TS) or `../sdkwork-specs/DART_CODE_SPEC.md` (Flutter).

- UI -> service -> injected SDK flow is preserved; components never construct SDK clients or
  assemble raw HTTP/auth headers.
- React: hooks rules clean (`react-hooks`), `useEffect` with full deps and cleanup, stable
  list keys, error boundaries at route/page level, derived state during render (not in effects).
- State: server state behind services/query layer; client state local or minimal typed store;
  no duplication of server state in client stores.
- Accessibility: accessible names, keyboard behavior, visible focus, color is never the only
  signal; error states announced.
- i18n for all user-facing copy in reusable/user-facing packages (I18N_SPEC §6.1).
- PC/H5 `outDir` uses `dist/{standalone,cloud}/{dev,test,staging,prod}`.

## pnpm Workspace Dependency And Package Import

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_WORKSPACE_DEPENDENCY_SPEC.md` (companion to
`../sdkwork-specs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).

Sibling SDKWork repositories are consumed through a dual-track model that MUST stay consistent:

- **Local development** (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`): pnpm workspace protocol. Each sibling
  package is declared ONCE in this repository root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` as a
  `../<sdkwork-sibling>` relative path, and consumed with `workspace:*` in `package.json`. Never use
  `file:`/`link:`/git-URL specifiers for SDKWork sibling packages in any environment.
- **CI / release packaging**: git-repository dependency checkout. Every sibling referenced by the
  local workspace MUST have a matching `dependencies[]` entry in `sdkwork.workflow.json` so CI
  clones the sibling into the same `../<sdkwork-sibling>` relative layout (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`).
  `package.json` is never rewritten for CI.

Import rules for sibling SDKWork packages:

- Import by package name only: `import { X } from "@sdkwork/package-name"`. The specifier MUST
  equal the target package's `package.json` `name` exactly - no shortening, renaming, or alias.
- Forbidden: relative imports that cross a package boundary into another SDKWork repository or
  another workspace package's `src/` (for example `import ... from "../../sdkwork-appbase/.../src/..."`).
- Consume only the public `exports` surface of a package; never deep-import sibling `src/` internals.
- Every non-relative import in a workspace member MUST resolve to that member's own
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (import closure).
- Vite aliases MUST NOT rename or redirect `@sdkwork/*` packages, MUST NOT be added to make a
  resolution error pass, and are allowed only for documented bootstrap/SDK-generation entrypoints.
- Fix a resolution failure by correcting the workspace declaration or the package `exports`,
  not by adding an alias.

<!-- SDKWORK-SDK-GENERATION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Generated SDK Output Is Generator-Owned

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`.

Everything generated under `sdks/` — `generated/server-openapi/` trees, generated language
workspaces, `dist/` build output, generated `sdkwork-sdk.json`, generated
`.sdkwork/sdkwork-generator-*` reports, and standardizer-synced OpenAPI snapshots — is produced by
the canonical SDK generator `../sdkwork-sdk-generator/bin/sdkgen.js` (`@sdkwork/sdk-generator`).

- Do not hand-edit generated SDK files, including type definitions, dist bundles, and generated
  package metadata. Manual edits are overwritten by the next generation run and break
  reproducibility and contract audits.
- When generated or compiled SDK output does not meet a contract or standard, fix the upstream
  source — authored API contract, route manifest, OpenAPI authority, derived `*.sdkgen.*` input,
  generator profile, or `custom/` runtime build scripts — then regenerate through the standard
  generation command. Do not patch generated output in place.
- Remove stale generated files by re-running the family generation command, which owns cleanup of
  disappeared routes and models; do not hand-prune generated trees.
- The only approved handwritten surfaces are `custom/` roots inside generated workspaces and
  authored `composed/` facades outside `generated/server-openapi`.

## Deployment Standard (bin/)

Per `../sdkwork-specs/MODULE_BIN_SPEC.md`, this module ships the standardized
nine-entrypoint `bin/` family; all build/package/deploy/installer work `MUST`
go through them. See `bin/README.md` for the usage card and
`bin/lib/module.sh` for the delegation wiring (hooks not yet wired to a
canonical repository command fail fast with guidance).

- App types declared: see `SDKWORK_APP_TYPES` in `bin/lib/module.sh`;
  environments: `development`, `test`, `staging`, `demo`, `production`.
- Image reference: `registry.sdkwork.com/apps/<docker-name>:<version>`
  (`DOCKER_SPEC.md` §2.1; no `latest`, no env-suffixed tags).
- Authoritative specs: `MODULE_BIN_SPEC.md`, `DOCKER_SPEC.md`,
  `DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `OPERATIONS_SPEC.md`.

<!-- SDKWORK-DESTRUCTIVE-OPERATION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Destructive Operation Safety

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATION_SPEC.md`.

Deletion must be explicit, enumerated, and reviewable. Deleting by pattern instead of by named
path is forbidden. Wildcards are for read-only commands only.

- `git rm -r`, `git rm` over a directory or pattern, and `git clean -f`/`-fd`/`-fdx` are
  FORBIDDEN. A recursive `git rm` stages many deletions in one index transaction; if the process
  is interrupted (SIGTERM, timeout, sandbox kill, crash) entries are already gone from disk while
  the index is only half-written, which is silent non-atomic mass data loss.
- Delete tracked files with `rm <exact/path>` on each named path, let `git status --short`
  record the `D` entries, then stage only the enumerated paths. Commit the deletion separately
  from functional changes.
- Shell and script deletion by wildcard is FORBIDDEN: `rm -rf`/`rm -r`/`rm -f` with
  `*`/`**`/`?`/`[...]`/brace expansion, `find ... -delete`, `find ... -exec rm`,
  `find ... | xargs rm`, `for f in *; do rm ...`, `del /S /Q`, `rd /S /Q`,
  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` on a glob, `shutil.rmtree`, `fs.rm(dir, { recursive: true })`,
  and `rimraf` over a glob.
- A deletion MUST NOT be combined in one shell invocation with a build, install, network, or
  publish step, and MUST NOT derive its targets from an unvalidated argument, environment
  variable, or configuration value.
- Permitted narrow deletion: `rm <exact/path>`; a short literal path list owned by the tool that
  declares it; the module's own generated artifacts through its owning tool
  (`pnpm clean`, `cargo clean`) per `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7; and
  `git restore --worktree --source=HEAD -- <exact paths>`.
- Required sequence before any deletion: enumerate exact paths; confirm every path resolves inside
  the active repository or module root; classify tracked/generated/cached/unknown; prefer `rm`
  plus tracked `git status`; delete in batches of 20 or fewer with a status check between
  batches; report the removed paths and the authorizing decision.
- Request explicit human confirmation before deleting any git-tracked path, any directory tree,
  any path resolving outside the active repository root, or more than 20 paths.
- Recovery after an accidental mass deletion: clear a stale `.git/index.lock`, write the path
  list to a file INSIDE the repository (never `/tmp` on Windows, where the Git Bash path space
  and the native tool path space disagree), and run a single
  `git restore --worktree --pathspec-from-file=<repo-relative-list>`. Never loop one
  version-control call per path; the same termination cause interrupts the loop part-way.

<!-- SDKWORK-ROLLBACK-RESTRICTION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rollback Restriction And Fix-Forward Discipline

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/ROLLBACK_RESTRICTION_SPEC.md`.

Errors are fixed forward. Version-control history is never rewound to make an error disappear.

- A rollback is any operation that moves a ref, resets the index or the working tree to an earlier
  state, discards uncommitted or committed work, or rewrites published history. It is FORBIDDEN as
  the remedy for a defect — a build failure, a type error, a lint failure, a failing test, a merge
  conflict, a runtime regression, a bad refactor, or an unclear diff. Repair forward instead, by
  adding, editing, or restoring content through a new commit.
- FORBIDDEN by an agent or a human-issued command: `git reset --hard` in any form;
  `git reset --merge`/`--keep`; `git reset <ref>` that discards staged or working-tree content;
  `git checkout -f`, `git switch -f`, `git restore --source=<ref> --worktree .`;
  `git revert` as a reflex error remedy; `git stash drop`/`clear` and `git stash pop` over a
  conflict; `git branch -D` on a branch with unmerged work; `git update-ref -d` and direct
  `.git/refs/` edits; `git reflog expire`, `git gc --prune=now`, `git prune`;
  `git commit --amend` over a pushed commit; `git rebase`, `git rebase -i`, `git rebase --onto`;
  `git filter-branch`; `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, and
  `git push --delete`.
- A rollback is never inferred from context or tone. "Fix it", "it's broken", "this is a mess",
  "start over", "just revert it", and "退回" are not rollback instructions. If the intent is
  ambiguous, STOP and ask — including whether the instruction means to discard work or to restore
  lost work, because that distinction decides the permissible operation.
- Discarding work requires a separate, explicit, human-issued instruction that names the operation,
  the target ref, the discarded span, and the reason, and that acknowledges the loss. The
  authorization must be quoted in the commit message. A standing authorization is not accepted.
- Recovery is ADDITIVE: `git restore --worktree --source=<ref> -- <exact paths>`, or
  `git checkout <good-ref> --pathspec-from-file=<repo-relative-list>` with the list written inside
  the repository. The pathspec must be an explicit enumerated list — never a directory, glob, brace
  expansion, or the repository root — and a restore is never combined with a build, install,
  publish, or commit step in the same shell invocation.
- Before a bulk restore: commit any local modification as a checkpoint; create a backup branch AND a
  tag AND a patch file and verify they point at the pre-restore state; produce a written
  three-snapshot blob comparison (damaged revision vs its parent vs the candidate older snapshot)
  that separates REPLACED files from files the damaged revision legitimately AUTHORED; restore the
  relative complement, not the whole tree; and keep the files the damaged revision added.
- Never treat a local tracking ref as evidence about a remote. Confirm with
  `git ls-remote <remote> <branch>` and record the returned object id.
- After a restore, verify by content hash rather than by reading files, re-run the gates that cover
  the restored surface, and classify each remaining failure as caused-by-the-restore or
  pre-existing. A pre-existing claim must be proven by showing the same failure at the prior
  revision with `git show <ref>:<path>`, not reasoned about. Fix forward. Never un-restore.
- Never bypass a hook, signature, or gate with `--force`, `--no-verify`, or `--no-gpg-sign` to
  land a repair.
